Animals have been living seclusion for so long, they've evolved in the most curious and surprising ways. But island living can carry a high price. *</p><p>*Recently, some dramatic changes have sweeping through these strange islands. At the western limits of the Pacific ocean, this is New Guinea,the world largest tropical island. In these isolated jungles there are only recently discovered by westerners and mountains that they have never visited. This is the home of a mammal first seen by scientists as recently as 1994. Even the locals rarely see it, it has never been filmed until now. It lives in trees , but it's not a monkey. Primates never made the jump across the water to this island. This is a rare glimpse of an almost unknown island oddity - the dingiso. Almost the size of a Labrador and with bear-like features. Is amazingly a type of kangaroo, a tree kangaroos. It lives in higher altitude than other kangaroos, hence the woolly coat. *</p><p>*Kangaroos usually feed on grass, but here in New Guinea, they've climbed into the trees where the greenery is more abundant. So the dingiso is a kangaroo which lives high in the mountains and climbs trees. But then islands do have a habit of producing rather unusual animals. Why? Because islands offer fresh opportunities to the cultures that they find their way there. With no monkeys in New Guinea, the freedom to browse in the trees has gone to the kangaroos. *</p><p>*New Guinea is a vast island nestled closed to the continental landmass of Australia, As we move south and east, to smaller, more distant islands, the wildlife become even more unusual. The little-known island of Caledonia is a small sliver of Australia that was cast adrift over 60 million years ago. It's home to a creature that seems to have evolved quite strangely. It has wings, but it can't fly. It's the Kagu. *</p><p>*Kagu families stick together, with young from previous helping declare the family territory. All intruders are chased away. It's breeding season, when the male rekindle the frame with their long-life partners. It's hard to know what the kagu is related to a heron, a rail, or maybe a pigeon. It's closest relative may actually be the sun bittern of South America, 7000 miles to the east. She may not seem too impressed, but then, kagus always keep their feet very firmly on the ground. Their wings are too weak to get them airborne, but why fly when all the food you need is on the ground? And with no large predators stalking this island, there's not much cause to take flight. But this life is not without its worries. A newly hatched click is hiding among food into mouth can be quite a challenge. Perhaps slimy worms just don't appeal. The chick's camouflage helps to hide it from aerial predators like the New Caledonian crow. Fortunately, Dad's wings still have a use - to help him look big and intimidating. The kagu may be an island oddity, but with few predators reaching the Pacific's isolated islands, flightless birds are more common here than anywhere else on earth. *</p><p>*Islands are a tops-turvy world, where evolution seems to follow a different set of rules. North of New Caledonia lies the Solomon Islands archipelago, a scattering of thousand tropical islands. For the select few animals that arrived here, these were brave new worlds, filled with possibilities. And to make the most of what they found here, some adopted a whole new way of life. Among the successful colonists were skinks-lizards that are usually small with short legs. Quite a variety live here in the Solomons, but there is one in these forests that's unlike any other skink on the planet. *</p><p>*The monkey-tailed skink is up to 50 times heavier than your average skink, and is the world's largest. Most skinks spend their lives on the ground, but not this monster. This is the only skink to possess a prehensile tail and unlike nearly all other skinks which dine on insects, this gentle giant is entirely vegetarian. As in New Guinea, there are no monkeys on these islands, so this skink fill the gap in the market and branched out. It forms social bonds with other monkey-tailed skinks, a rare characteristic among reptiles of any description. This skink may be an oddity, but that is exactly why it thrives here. *</p><p>*For a leaf-eater these islands are paradise. For others, though, life can be a little harder. Islanders only succeed by making the most of what's around them. Even spiders have their uses. On Santa Catalina Island in the Solomons, a fisherman prepares to go fishing. He seeks out a particular spider web, one that is strong and intricately spun. The fish he's after can't be caught hooks, their mouths are too narrow. So he has to be creative. No rod or reel, just a kite, and the spider silk,wound into a lure. The spider-silk lure hangs below the kite, flitting across the water like an insect. Now he must steer the kite to where he thinks the fish are gathered. Somewhere,just beneath the surface, shoals of needlefish lie in wait. He keeps a close eye in the kite - if it drops, a fish is snared. No hook is needed. The sharp teeth and rough scales of the needlefish are tangled in the spider silk. It's clever, it's effective and many fish can be caught in this way. Their ability to the survival of the Pacific's first human colonizers. But it wasn't all plain sailing the Pacific's more remote islands were some of the last places on Earth to be discovered by humans. *</p><p><em>These islands are so hard to reach that before humans arrived, only one new species of plant or animal turned up here every 35000 years. For those lucky few that made it, this was a land of milk and honey. Amazingly, one single type of finch evolved into 58 different species and all because the birds that normally fill these roles, like hummingbirds and woodpeckers,never made it to these islands. landfall in the Pacific is a risky business. Most islands are small, low and rather uniform, with few lifestyle choices on offer. But there is an archipelago that truly bucks the trend. Two of the largest islands in the Pacific have everything a castaway could dream of. Here lives a greater diversity of unique island creatures than almost anywhere else in the South Pacific. Forested valleys, turbulent rivers and glacier-topped peaks, this is New Zealand. A thousand miles long and with a mountainous spine rising one-and-a-half miles above the ocean, New Zealand offered a world of possibilities to creatures that found their way here.</em></p><p>Alpine parrots, called &quot;kea&quot;, after their calls. Living higher than any other parrots, these are possibly the world's most playful birds. But most of New Zealand's pioneering creatures were drawn to the forest below. And here, too, given the strange nature of life on Pacific islands, it pays to expect the unexpected. And the last thing thing you might expect to see here is penguins. These are Fiordland crested penguins, named after this corner of south New Zealand, and their funky hairdo. They're on their daily trip to the sea. Despite hanging out in the forest, they haven't lost their taste for fish. So why are these woodlands so attractive to penguins? Because there are no large predators here, it's a safe place for bringing up baby. A freshwater stream through the forest makes a handy highway for a penguin heading home from a fishing trip with a crop full of food.</p><p>Born in the forest, they stay in the forest, while Mum and Dad bring fresh meals straight from the ocean. They can hear the waves, they can even smell the spray, but they have no idea what it looks like. These chicks won't have their first splash in the ocean until they're three months old, when they'll finally set off on their first fishing trip, alone. 1500 miles from the nearest continent, New Zealand is beyond the reach of most mammals. Marine mammals aside, the only ones that did succeed, before humans arrived, had wings. Bats.</p><p>This is the short-tailed bat. It roosts in tree cavities and comes out at night to feed. So far, so normal. But these bats have been living the island life far too long not to have become a little &quot;different&quot;. And they're not the only ones. Wetas are primitive relatives of locust, but they can't fly. Seeing an opportunity, the bats pounced. After all, why waste energy hawking for insects in the sky, when there is such a feast on the forest floor? New Zealand's night-time creepy-crawlies are at the mercy of these bats. Some try to put up a fight, but they're no match for this army of predators. These bats have special sheaths that protect their wings, all the better to burrow through the leaves. So even worms aren't safe. The very first bat evolved from a mouse-like many millions of years ago. Here on New Zealand, it seems evolution has gone into reverse. And if New Zealand's bats have turned to mice,what on earth has happened to the birds? In these forests lives a bird that is about as un-bird-like as it is possible for bird to be. It's nocturnal, though it sometimes wakes up before sunset. It has whiskers so it can feel its way in the dark.</p><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/%E8%AF%BE%E6%96%87/" rel="tag"><i class="ic i-tag"></i> 课文</a></div></div><footer><div class="meta"><span
